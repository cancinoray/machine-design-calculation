  - Preliminary; sketches, scale CAD drawings, materials selection, appearance and styling.
  - Functional analysis; strength, stiffness, vibration, shock, fatigue, temperature, wear, lubrication. Customer endurance and maintenance cost estimate.
  - Producibility; machine tools, joining methods, material supply and handling, manual vs automated manufacture. 
  - Cost to design and manufacture one or more models in small and large quantities.
  - Market place: present competition and life expectancy of the product.

### Tech-stack that I will be using
  - [Vue 3 (Composition API)](https://vuejs.org/)
  - [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
  - [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) for the components
  - I'm not sure if I need a database and server as of now.
